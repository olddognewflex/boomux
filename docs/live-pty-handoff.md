## macOS preview

The authority, quiescence, rollback, PID-preservation, and bounded-transfer
requirements in this contract also apply to the macOS preview. Linux-specific
mechanisms below retain their behavior. Darwin uses `BOOMUXM1`, validates the
PTY with `TIOCPTYGNAME` and process terminal/session identity, and transfers a
read-only process identity descriptor instead of a pidfd. The receiver verifies
the kernel process unique identifier and creates a local kqueue exit monitor.
Signals use the identity-checked audit-token API, with no PID-only fallback.

Darwin cannot execute `/dev/fd/N`. Before quiescing, replacement preparation
creates an owner-private hard link to the validated executable and verifies its
device/inode against the open descriptor. It executes that alias with the
original absolute path as argv[0]. Failure, including cross-filesystem linking,
leaves the old daemon authoritative. Successful replacements retain the alias
until exit; cold startup under the daemon lock reclaims stale aliases. Official
macOS self-update remains outside the preview.

## Goal

Replace the Boomux daemon without terminating running shell processes or ending
active terminal sessions. Metadata-only recovery remains the crash fallback;
handoff is an explicit, acknowledged upgrade path.

## Invariants

- Exactly one daemon reads each PTY at a time.
- The old daemon remains authoritative until the replacement acknowledges every
  imported runtime.
- The listener socket and both daemon lock file descriptions keep their existing
  ownership across the transition.
- A failed replacement resumes the old daemon without killing shells.
- Every active primary controller and collaborator acknowledges a reconnect
  boundary before PTY transfer.
- Sanitized terminal reconstruction retains active focus- and color-scheme-
  reporting subscriptions within the attachment frame bound.
- Received descriptors are close-on-exec, strictly typed by marker, and closed
  on every malformed transfer.

## Selecting a release executable

Ordinary `boomux daemon restart` replaces the daemon from its existing installed
path. Invoking that command through a different CLI does not select that CLI's
executable. Versioned Desktop bundles instead use:

```sh
boomux daemon restart --executable /absolute/release/path/bin/boomux
```

`--refresh-environment` explicitly refreshes daemon-owned services from the
invoking client's ephemeral environment. The existing
`RestartWithNotificationConfig.environment` field carries it; it is never
persisted. The receiver validates the environment and requires the same resolved
runtime and state directories before beginning handoff. Running Shells and the
Shared Harness Runtime retain their original processes and environments.
Without the option, restart preserves the daemon environment. Combined with
`--executable`, the CLI first completes and verifies executable handoff, then
requests a second environment-refresh handoff. A second-step failure leaves the
upgraded daemon running and is reported as a failure, never a destructive stop.

Protocol 52 adds `restart_executable` and `RestartWithExecutable`. The current
client refuses this mutation on older daemons before requesting a restart. The
owner daemon requires a canonical absolute path to a regular native ELF binary,
owned by the user or root, executable and not writable by other users. It opens
and pins the inspected inode before quiescing runtimes, then executes through
that descriptor. The existing H8 prepare/finalize and rollback rules apply;
this does not change the private handoff manifest or persisted state. The CLI
also verifies the replacement's actual executable path before reporting success.

A daemon from before protocol 52 needs a one-time upgrade through its owning
installation method before Desktop can move it to a versioned bundle. Eligible
standalone release installs can use `boomux update`, which replaces their existing
installed path. Desktop does not overwrite independent installations or stop live
Shells to bypass this compatibility boundary.

## Transfer Manifest

The private handoff channel carries a versioned manifest followed by Unix
`SCM_RIGHTS` descriptors:

- Existing listener socket
- Runtime and state lock files
- One PTY master per running shell
- Shell and run IDs, terminal profile, PID/session identity, output revision,
  and sanitized VT state
- Exited-shell run identity, exit status, output revision, terminal profile, and
  sanitized final VT state without process descriptors
- The latest non-durable focused-terminal revision and workspace/shell/run
  identity, when it still refers to a transferred runtime
- The latest non-durable Node-qualified presentation focus and its monotonic
  revision, including an external Node Shell when that was focused most recently
- The Shared Harness Runtime generation, strict PID/start/runtime identity, and
  supervision state, without Agent Session Claims
- Bounded Claude Remote Control bindings for exact transferred Agent/ShellRuns,
  without additional descriptors
- Bounded Kiro Launch Holders with exact PID/start identity and Session/Agent
  associations, without additional descriptors; import also requires the exact
  ShellRun and active Kiro Agent associations to remain current

The PTY master is full duplex, so reader and writer duplicates do not need to be
transferred separately. The replacement cannot inherit Unix parenthood; process
monitoring and cleanup therefore need an imported-process representation, with
a Linux pidfd where available.

Bootstrap version 8 starts with the `BOOMUXH8` header, accepts only an H8 sender,
and has bounded read/write deadlines. H7 and all earlier manifests are rejected
before descriptor import. The receiver validates the listener path/type,
forces nonblocking mode, matches both lock-file inodes, and establishes exclusive
flock ownership before acknowledging readiness. Explicit abort closes every
received duplicate without affecting descriptors retained by the old daemon.

The H8-only boundary accompanies the protocol-47 removal of Agent Schedules and
Scheduled Executions. In particular, v0.32/state schema 13 cannot gracefully
self-update into this release. The operator must stop the old daemon, accepting
that every managed process terminates, reset the incompatible state and removed
configuration keys described in [`local-update.md`](local-update.md), then
install and cold-start the new binary.

For each running shell, every active primary controller and collaborator first
acknowledges its reconnect boundary and the old reader pauses before the manifest is captured. The
replacement validates the session leader and pidfd, reconstructs terminal state,
and waits at `PREPARED`; it does not begin reading the PTY until `FINALIZE`, so
rollback cannot consume output belonging to the old daemon.
PTY/session identity is cross-checked with `TIOCGSID`, terminal reconstructions
use separate bounded frames, and imported process/session cleanup uses pidfds to
avoid signaling a reused numeric PID.

Exited shells use a separate static transfer record and bounded reconstruction
frame. The replacement validates that the transferred identity and exit status
match the persisted completed run, then restores the exited lifecycle without
opening a PTY or starting a process.

Handoff version 4 also transfers the event stream UUID, high-water mark, and
bounded retained events. The replacement publishes `handoff_completed` before
resuming readers, so output revisions remain ordered after the ownership
boundary. The optional focused-terminal snapshot crosses the same graceful
handoff so dashboard following does not forget the last focused managed window;
ordinary cold recovery does not restore it.
Protocol-39 qualified presentation focus crosses the same handoff independently
from PTY ownership, so a later local or external focus gain always advances past
the revision already observed by a surviving dashboard.
An intermediate protocol-38 replacement may omit this additive field. A
surviving dashboard detects the negotiated protocol transition from the
`handoff_completed` boundary and resets its observed focus frontier once, so
each protocol's revision domain remains usable.

Handoff 5 transfers a strictly identified Shared Harness Runtime generation so
the replacement resumes supervision without changing its PID or server
generation. Agent Session Claims deliberately do not cross the manifest.
Surviving TUI holders reacquire claims after reconnect; until then the server
plugin has no ShellRun lifecycle authority. Rollback leaves runtime supervision
with the old daemon. Cold startup adopts an existing runtime only when every
identity check matches, and `boomux daemon stop` terminates it.
Handoff 6 transfers only Claude Remote Control bindings that still identify an
exact active Claude Agent and transferred ShellRun. The replacement revalidates
them before `PREPARED`; rollback leaves the old daemon's map intact. The map is
not durable, and cold startup begins without bindings.

## Accepted Remote Node Boundary

Protocol 35 implements the accepted remote attachment boundary. A remote PTY
descriptor, process handle, runtime, and reconstruction state remain
owned by the remote daemon and never enter a local handoff manifest. Remote
daemon replacement uses this existing descriptor-transfer protocol on the
remote machine, and its attachment reconnect frames pass unchanged through the
SSH bridge.
Remote transactional upgrade copies the old executable into private rollback
state before atomically replacing its installed pathname. It does not rename the
live executable to the backup path: on Linux the old daemon therefore observes a
deleted installed path and selects the replacement at that path for graceful
handoff. Rollback performs the inverse atomic replacement before asking the
provisional daemon to hand off to the restored executable.

Local daemon replacement instead closes federation admission, drains admitted
Node requests and projection commits to known outcome boundaries, stops
synchronization workers, establishes a reconnect boundary with each local
attachment client, and quiesces SSH proxies without claiming remote PTYs. The
replacement opens fresh identity-verified bridges and starts workers only after
finalization. Rollback returns routing and workers to the old local daemon and
does not alter remote ownership. Simultaneous local and remote replacement must
preserve both prepare/finalize boundaries independently; neither side can infer
success from transport EOF. See [`remote-nodes.md`](remote-nodes.md).

## Delivery Slices

1. [Complete] Implement and test strict single-descriptor `SCM_RIGHTS` transport.
2. [Complete] Replace erased PTY reader/writer ownership with a Boomux-owned Unix
   runtime and a pauseable, joinable reader task.
3. [Complete] Add replacement-daemon bootstrap over a private
   socketpair and transfer the listener and lock descriptors with readiness
   acknowledgement.
   `boomux daemon restart` now uses prepare/finalize commit semantics, preserves
   the socket pathname, and rolls back to the old daemon before finalization.
4. [Complete] Transfer detached shell runtimes and prove PID, input, output,
   resize, repeated replacement, rollback, and later cleanup survive.
5. [Complete] Add cooperative attachment reconnection with ordered
   `Reconnect`/`ReconnectAck` framing. Input sent before the ACK is processed by
   the old daemon; later terminal input remains queued while the client retries
   the replacement in raw mode.
6. [Complete] Transfer exited-run metadata and bounded final terminal state as
   static lifecycle records alongside any live runtimes.

## First Acceptance Test

Start a detached shell, record its PID, replace the daemon, reconnect, and prove
the PID is unchanged. Input, output, resize, lock exclusivity, metadata mutation,
and a later destructive `daemon stop` must still work.
